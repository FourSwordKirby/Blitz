Things to do:

Fireballs lose trails after death
Add collision layers
Double jumping can make you fall through platforms

Add motion trails/visuals:
	Use trail renderers (a base script in unity)
	Just use solid color for your material

Miranda's suggestions:
	Suggestion for super flash effect
		-add a filter on top of the screen which can be used for the actual super flash visuals.


Rachel's suggestion
	-Take the sprites we have bold the outlines to make the characters look better
	-More effects because it looks boring
	-Potentially use motion blur to cover up lag effects / choppiness
	-Markers above the player to indicate which player is who
	-Rachel should contact me with another contact's fighting game engine code thing.


	Rachel game dezine ideas:
		playabe 8.5 - 11 page fit game ideas


Tommy's suggestion:
	Fix attack lag before the stomp
		-In the case were we have to limit scope to 2 attacks, make the fireball better
	Make characters "feel" stronger

Tom suggestion:
	-Make the firebal more missle like
	-Fewer but bigger projectiles for this scenario
	-Color the outline for teams


Daniel's suggestion:
	For the super flash attack, freeze everything.
		-To do this, set static variables on game object which need to stop
