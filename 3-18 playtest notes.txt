Things to do:

Programming: includ orb pickup effect

Priority: Fireball firing animation
		Fireball stomp animation

Miranda's suggestions:
	Suggestion for super flash effect
		-add a filter on top of the screen which can be used for the actual super flash visuals.


Rachel's suggestion
	-Take the sprites we have bold the outlines to make the characters look better
	-More effects because it looks boring
	-Potentially use motion blur to cover up lag effects / choppiness
	-Markers above the player to indicate which player is who


Tommy's suggestion:
	Fix attack lag before the stomp
		-In the case were we have to limit scope to 2 attacks, make the fireball better
	Make characters "feel" stronger

Tom suggestion:
	-Make the firebal more missle like
	-Fewer but bigger projectiles for this scenario
	-Color the outline for teams
